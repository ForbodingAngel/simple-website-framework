Creating websites shouldn't be a daunting task. With Skeleton Website Framework, simplicity and functionality merge seamlessly, offering you a hassle-free experience in website development.

**Building Blocks of Simplicity**

Inspired by the elegance of the Skeleton boilerplate, our framework embodies simplicity at its core. We've meticulously crafted every aspect to reflect a clean and minimalistic style, ensuring that your websites look sleek and professional without unnecessary clutter.

**Streamlined Development Process**

Forget about tedious setup tasks. With Skeleton Website Framework, all the groundwork is already laid out for you. Our framework provides a solid foundation, allowing you to focus on unleashing your creativity rather than getting lost in the complexities of coding.

**Effortless Page Creation**

Pages and posts are a breeze to create with our framework. Utilizing Markdown, simply place your Markdown files in the designated folders, and they automatically become linkable pages. Navigation options are also Markdown-based, providing an intuitive way to structure your website.

**Flexibility at Your Fingertips**

Designed with an easy-to-understand templating system, our framework empowers you to customize your website effortlessly. Whether you're a novice developer or a seasoned pro, extending the functionality of your website has never been easier.

**12 Column Grid System for Easy Content Positioning**

Positioning content has never been simpler. Our framework comes equipped with a 12 column grid system, allowing you to arrange elements with precision and ease. Whether you're creating a landing page or a complex layout, our grid system ensures optimal alignment every time.

**Clone and Customize**

Harness the power of our base theme to kickstart your projects. Developers can clone the base theme and create their own themes, significantly reducing development time and effort. The possibilities are endless, allowing you to tailor your website to suit your unique vision.

**Built for Security**

Safety is our priority. By forgoing an integral built-in editor, we minimize the risk of penetration attacks. Our framework is hardened against security threats, ensuring peace of mind for you and your users.

**SEO-Optimized**

Stay ahead in the digital landscape with our SEO-ready framework. From optimized page structures to metadata management, Skeleton Website Framework is primed for maximum visibility and performance in search engine results.

**Extend with Ease**

Enhance your website's functionality with our easy-to-use and extend plugin system. Whether you're adding new features or integrating third-party plugins, our framework provides a seamless experience without compromising security or stability.

**Editor for Your Convenience**

While an optional editor is available, it remains separate from the core framework. Serving primarily as a standalone tool, it offers advanced editing and file management capabilities alongside your website. With its built-in authentication system, you can rest assured that your files are secure.

**Experience the Ease**

Skeleton Website Framework is designed with you in mind. Whether you're a hobbyist website owner or a novice developer, our framework offers a user-friendly experience that simplifies the website development process. Welcome to the future of web development. Welcome to Skeleton Website Framework.
